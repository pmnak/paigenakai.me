## What Worked Well
Everything seemed to go fine, I didn't run into any big issues. I was able to install and get most things running smoothly. 

## What Didn't
I had a little bit of trouble with getting the image to load, I'm not sure what fixed it, but it's now properly displaying. I am still a little confused on certain parts so I will probably need to read the descrip again or find some other sources on what's going on.
