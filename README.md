# React Intro

Created a YouTube like webpage using React.

## What Worked Well
I was able to get the end result needed, it was fairly understandable. I was also able to get the starter code into this project. 

## What Didn't
I had some minor errors throughout the process that took me quite a while to figure out. My videoID kept coming back as undefined for the longest time which caused issues with the video playback, a small minor change fixed it though. I also had issues with my deployment. It wasn't showing up for the longest time as what I had on my locally run server.
